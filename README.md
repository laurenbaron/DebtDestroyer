# Debt Destroyer
Swetha Sankar and Lauren Baron's 2019 Technica Hackathon project for promoting Financial Literacy through a fun game that shows how debt accumulates fast and to tackle it piece by piece. This Arcade game was coded in Python in under 24 hours and is a financial twist on the Asteroid Destroyer game.
